# SQL-joins
Review paper on SQL joins
The author Abraham Silberschatz explained join operator in a book (Database System Concepts sixth edition) as “SQL join operator is used to combine records from two or more tables based on a common fields between them”. In sql there are different types of join operators are placed which are differenced according to their definitions.
Inner join is for returning the common records between the two tables and it had two types of join they are equi join (which returns the common records of the table) and non equi join (it will return the database according to the comparison operators).

Next we have outer join which is the most used joins in the sql it has three types of the join in it namely left outer join, right outer join, full outer join. The best advantage of the outer join is you can easily guess the definition of the operator like left outer join returns that it will return the whole left table in the result and the right outer join return the right table of the database in the result and finally full outer join which return the total two table in the result. 

These are the sql join which are very helpful in the business sections, like when you need to select the related data of the left table or the right table or if you want to select the table according to the Cartesian product of the both tables then there is an option join operator which is called as cross or Cartesian join.
	Finally the cross join which is also called as Cartesian join. It is called as Cartesian join because it products the elements in the tables of the table in Cartesian product which is completely similar to the mathematical method in real life. In mathematical model every element in one vector will be produced to the every element in another table.
